## Project Overview
This analysis is an insight for agriculture, which emphasize deriving meaningful trends by carefully analyzing different parameters inorder to get a satisfiable insight that compel us in making a meaningul decision
Let's get to it ðŸ˜ƒ

## Data Source
The dataset was fetched from kaggle site

## Tools Used
- Kaggle site for getting the raw data
- Microsoft excel for fetching the data and seeing what it looks like
- Microsoft Power Bi for cleaning of data and reporting

## Exploratory Data Analysis
   In this agricultural dataset, it has 74918 Rows, that's much right?, with different years and lots of commodities. So we want to deduce insights from this large set of data. Insights like
  - The year with the highest price sales
  - LGA which has the highest commodity sales
  - The KPI estimation of the company and if they meant their requirements, and lots more
 
## Data Cleaning
- I started by transforming my raw data
- Changing the data type to their correct data type
- Removing the null values
- Replacing some vaues that were written in alphabets to numbers

## Power Bi query used
I did some conditional formatting
