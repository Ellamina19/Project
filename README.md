## Project Overview
This analysis is an insight for agriculture, which emphasize deriving meaningful trends by carefully analyzing different parameters inorder to get a satisfiable insight that compel us in making a meaningul decision
Let's get to it ðŸ˜ƒ

## Data Source
The dataset was fetched from kaggle site

## Tools Used
- Kaggle site for getting the raw data
- Microsoft excel for fetching the data and seeing what it looks like
- Microsoft Power Bi for cleaning of data and reporting

## Exploratory Data Analysis
   In this agricultural dataset, it has 74918 Rows, that's much right?, with different years and lots of commodities. So we want to deduce insights from this large set of data. Insights like
  - The year with the highest price sales
  - LGA which has the highest commodity sales
  - The KPI estimation of the company and if they meant their requirements, and lots more
 
## Data Cleaning
- I started by transforming my raw data
- Changing the data type to their correct data type
- Removing the null values
- Replacing some vaues that were written in alphabets to numbers

## Power Bi query used
I did some conditional formatting 

## Findings 1

From the above analysis, we derived the the following insight:
- The company meant with their commodity price target which is 30million, and even crossed their target
- At 1301721176, Maiduguri had the highest sum of price and was 72.44% higher than Potiskum, which had the lowest Sum of price at 754901160
- Maiduguri accounted for 9.14% of Sum of price
- Across all 15 LGA , Sum of price ranged from 754901160 to 1301721176
- At 15408598515, Sum of price has exceeded the target goal of 30 million
- Sum of price trended up, resulting in a 26,115.53% increase between 2002 and 2023
- Sum of price started trending up on 2017, rising by 27.43% (125186206) in 6 years
- Sum of price jumped from 456444912 to 58163118 during its steepest incline between 2017 and 2023
- Borno had the lowest sum of price by year whereas Abia had the highest sum of price by year 2022
- Maiduguri had the highest commodity sale
